    <p>I spent 4 years of my life drinking in East Lansing, Michigan...Oops. I meant to say I graduated from Michigan State University. I majored in journalism but quickly discovered 
    that I didn't want to go to cool events for work but eat ramen in my parents basement because I couldn't afford anything when I was trying to be a journalist. I've worked in several
    industries including film and television, insurance, law and government but now I'm trying to get into the tech game...but the struggle is real. Pray for me.

<p> Currently I am on a bowling league. My team sucks at bowling but we have a good time and that's all that matters. Gutter Gang! I like to 
    find weird shows and binge watch them and go on twitter and talk to other people that watched them. I got hooked on anime and lately I've been watching Demon Slayer. If you have any anime 
suggestions let me know. Soon Detroit will be a ice block and I won't be leaving my house.     </p>
