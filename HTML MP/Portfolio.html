            <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>

<p> I am currently working on building up my portfolio. I have completed several projects but I am still in the learning phase and some things can definitely
be improved. Here are some links to a few projects I worked on. <br>



<br>The mockbuster lab was a CRUD assigment where I created, read, updated and deleted items from a list based on the users choices.

<br>The exponents lab was a math based lab that demonstrated loops.<br>

</a>





<br>The rooom calculator lab was a lab that accepted user input and created a new variable and displayed it back to the user. <br>
